    alternate after each round:
    </h4>


    <h4 id = "round1">Section 1: 
        <br>1. You get a random word to start a word chain with
        <br>2. Make as many connections as you can to each word before it
        <br>3. You will have 15 seconds. Points are based on how long your chain is!
        <br>  Eg. America -> Trump -> Orange -> Fruit
    </h4>

    <h4 id = "round2">Section 2: 
        <br>1. The last word you input in Section 1 will be your start word
        <br>2. You will be given a random word you must end your word chain with
        <br>3. Use as little time as possible to make word connections to complete the chain.
