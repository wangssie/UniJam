    <h4 id = "round1">Round part 1: 
        <br>1. At the start of the round a random word is given to you to start your chain
        <br>2. Make as many connections as you can to each word before it
        <br>3. You will have 15 seconds. Points are based on how long your chain is!
        <br>  Eg. America -> Trump -> Orange -> Fruit -> Sweet -> Sugar
    </h4>

    <h4 id = "round2">Round part 2: 
        <br>4. The last word you input in Section 1 will be your starting word for the next section
        <br>5. You will be given a random word that you must end your word chain with
        <br>6. Use as little time as possible to make word connections to complete the chain.
        <br><br>If you make a mistake, delete the word by clicking it
    </h4>

    <h4 id = "check">Checking stage: 
        <br>7. Once you finish the round, the other player will validate your word connections
        <br>8. If something seems a little "dodgy", the player can remove your word and you will lose a point
        <br>  Eg. America -> Swimming pool (?!)
